# Rassad – Smart Reversal Window

Rassad is an AI-inspired security solution designed to protect users from unintended or risky actions in sensitive digital services by introducing a **Smart Reversal Window**.

This repository intentionally contains **two different implementations** of the Rassad solution, each serving a distinct purpose in demonstrating the idea.

---

## 1️⃣ Frontend Demo (GitHub Pages)

🔗 **Live Demo:**  
https://smaher333.github.io/Rassad/

This version represents the **initial UI/UX prototype** of Rassad and is deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

It focuses on:
- User journey visualization  
- Interface flow for sensitive services  
- Concept demonstration of the Smart Reversal Window  

This demo is **frontend-only** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and is optimized for fast access and easy review by the judging committee.

---

## 2️⃣ Advanced Backend MVP (ASP.NET Core MVC)

The folder below contains the **advanced technical implementation** of the Rassad system:

```

smart-reversal-mvc/

````

This version is built using **ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8)** and includes:
- Server-side logic and controllers  
- Security and risk evaluation simulation  
- Smart action handling for sensitive operations  
- Backend-driven system behavior  

⚠️ **Note:** GitHub Pages does not support backend technologies such as ASP.NET.  
For this reason, this part of the project is designed to run **locally or on a cloud hosting service**.

### ▶️ Run Locally
```bash
cd smart-reversal-mvc
dotnet run
````

##  Why Two Versions?

This structure reflects a **real-world product development approach**:

* The frontend demo allows quick concept understanding and usability review
* The backend MVP demonstrates technical depth and system feasibility

Together, they present a complete view of both **user experience** and **technical implementation** of the Rassad solution.

---

##  Technology Stack

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend Demo)
* ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8)
* C#
* Razor Views

---

##  Team – Rassad

Developed as part of a collaborative team project focusing on secure digital services and user protection.

---

## Notes for Reviewers

* The live demo link represents the **conceptual interface**
* The backend MVP showcases the **actual system logic**
* Both parts are complementary and intentionally separated for clarity and practicality
